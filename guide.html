<p class="editable">The Agodjie were an all-female regiment that emerged in the Kingdom
of Dahomey during the eighteenth century. Dahomey was a West African
centralized and militarized kingdom in what is today the Republic of
Benin. In 1727, during the era of the Atlantic slave trade, Dahomey
conquered the Kingdom of Hueda, and gained access to the sea. Through
this conquest, the kingdom controlled the port of Ouidah, which between
the early 1500s and 1866 was the <a
href="http://slavevoyages.org" target="_blank">second busiest slave-trading port</a>,
only behind Luanda, in West Central Africa. To explore this story in
more detail, check the section <a
href="/themes/#history-dahomey">History
of Dahomey</a>. Nigerian historian Isaac Adeagbo Akinjobgin wrote one of
the first monographs on the history of Dahomey. American anthropologist
Melville Herskovits also published a two-volume book on Dahomey.</p>

<p class="editable">The population of Dahomey were men and women identified as Fon. Fon
is a Gbe language, still spoken today by nearly two million people in the
Republic of Benin. As the movie The Woman King underscores, royal women
were not mere spectators of the developments of Dahomey. During a short
period of time in the early eighteenth century, Tassi Hangbé, the
daughter of King Huegabja became either Dahomey’s regent or the queen
(we do not know exactly), after her own brother died and a new king was
appointed. The origins of the Agodjie are probably associated with
Hangbé, as she may have created a guard formed just by women. To know
more about the Agodjie, visit the section <a
href="/themes/#agodjie">Agodjie, women warriors and Fon women</a>. 
As you will see, several scholars
wrote about Fon women and the Agodjie. Probably, the most well-known
book focusing on Fon royal women is Edna G. Bay’s <em>Wives of the Leopard</em>.
Stanley B. Alpern also wrote the popular book <em>Amazons of Black Sparta</em>
about Dahomey women warriors. Other scholars such as Robin Law and
Suzanne Preston Bllier also wrote several other articles and chapters
about the Agodjie, while other scholars in the Republic of Benin and in
France also studied these women warriors. Ana Lucia Araujo explored the
story of Na Agontimé, the mother of King Guezo, who was sold and sent
into slavery to Brazil. As scholar Pierre Verger has argued, Na Agontimé
was very probably the founder of the Candomblé temple Casa das Minas in
São Luís do Maranhão in Brazil.</p>

<p class="editable">The movie The Woman King shows Agodjie gathered around altars and
making offerings of food and drinks to their deceased warrior mates. In
one scene, Amenza (Shelia Atim) consults the Ifa for Nanisca (Viola
Davis). Although Dahomean religion is not perfectly portrayed in the
movie, it offers us the opportunity to know more about the Vodun
religion practiced in Dahomey. As explained by art historian Suzanne
Preston Blier, Vodun is a religion that honors several deities and
(royal) ancestors. In addition to the worship of numerous deities, Vodun is
characterized by trance and spirit possession. Vodun followers and
initiates dance, sing, and play musical instruments. There is also many
rich forms of art associated with Vodun religion. To know more check the
segment <a

religion</a> and <a

human remains</a>.</p>
<p class="editable">Dahomey was not isolated. Its rulers sought to expand the kingdom’s
borders. After conquering the Kingdom of Allada in 1724 and the Kingdom
of Hueda in 1727, Dahomey continued fighting its neighbors, including
the Mahi in the north, and Oyo in the west. In the movie, the story revolves
around the Dahomeyan conflict with Oyo. You can learn more about the Oyo in 
our <a href="/themes/#vodun"></a>Oyo empire, Kingdom of Oyo</a> section. 
Although the history of Dahomey and of the Agodjie are not synonyms with the
history of the Atlantic slave trade and slavery, most prisoners of these wars 
were transported to the coast where they were sold and forced to board slave
ships. Most ships that left from Ouidah after 1727 transported enslaved
people to Brazil. But several slave ships also carried enslaved Africans
to Saint-Domingue and other parts of the Americas. In 1860, the slave
ship Clotilda transported from Ouidah more than 100 enslaved people to
Mobile in Alabama. Clotilda is known as the last slave ship that carried
enslaved Africans to the United States, where the African slave trade
had been made illegal in 1808. In 1927, African-American author and
anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston interviewed Oluale Kossola (Cudjo
Lewis), one of the captives brought to Alabama on board the Clotilda.
His story was recently published in Barracoon: The Story of the Last
“Black Cargo. Kossola’s story, and the Clotilda’s story, were also
explored by historian Sylviane A. Diouf in her book Dreams of Africa in
Alabama: The Slave Ship Clotilda and the Story of the Last Africans
Brought to America.</p>
<p class="editable">A number of enslaved Africans who were transported from Ouidah to
Brazil, especially to Bahia, were able to purchase their freedom during
the nineteenth century. After the Malê slave rebellion of 1835 failed,
Brazilian authorities sentenced Africans who alleged participated in the
revolt with deportation to the Bight of Benin. Transported to ports such
as Ouidah and Lagos, these men and women joined a community of Brazilian
slave traders and freedpeople that existed in the region since the
eighteenth century. Indeed, Brazilian slave traders, including some who
were formerly enslaved, were the majority of the slave traders based in
Ouidah during the nineteenth century. Therefore, slave traders who spoke
Portuguese like Santo Ferreira (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) and Malik (Jordan
Bolger) who are featured in the movie existed in significant numbers in
Ouidah until the 1860s. To know more check the sections <a
href="/themes/#dahomey">Dahomey and
the Atlantic Slave Trade</a> and <a
href="/themes/#afro-brazilians">Afro-Brazilians
in the Bight of Benin</a>.</p>
<p class="editable">The history of West African women does not start or end with the
Agodjie. Yet, the experience of these women warriors can help us better
understand the history of West African women and Black women in the
Americas. To know more check the section <a
href="/themes/#african-women">African
women in the era of the Atlantic slave trade</a>.</p>
<p class="editable">What happened to the Agodjie? After the end of the Atlantic slave
trade to the Americas in the 1860s, France invaded Dahomey in 1890.
Dahomey became a French colony in 1894. French officials took thousands
of objects, artifacts, and artworks from Dahomey during the war of
conquest and colonization. To this day, most of these items are
scattered in museums in France, other European countries, and in the
United States. After its independence from France, Dahomey was renamed
Republic of Benin. The country has been memorializing the Atlantic slave
trade since the early 1990s. The palaces of Abomey featured in The Woman
King are listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1985. The UNESCO
Project <a
href="https://en.unesco.org/themes/fostering-rights-inclusion/slave-route"  target="_blank">The
Routes of Enslaved Peoples</a> (former Slave Route Project) was launched
in Ouidah in 1994. The Republic of Benin’s cities of Porto-Novo,
Cotonou, Ouidah, and Abomey feature several monuments, memorials, and
museums telling Dahomey’s history and the painful history of the
Atlantic slave trade. These landmarks also tell the story of Vodun and
the Dahomey women warriors. Moreover, in 2021, France returned to Benin
more than twenty-six objects taken from the royal palaces of Abomey
during the wars of conquest. Among these objects is the throne of King
Guezo (played in The Woman King by John Boyega). Benin is creating a new
museum in Abomey, where the royal palaces still stand, to show these
treasures.</p>
<p class="editable">We hope that this syllabus, and the movie The Woman King, will drive
us to better understand the history, the culture, the art, and the
religions of Dahomey. Through these materials, we hope to spark
curiosity and encourage many of you to learn about the history of West
Africa.</p>
